# Ender 3 V2 JyersUI: Deuspi edition üöÄ

This fork was created for my own purposes.  
I'm not responsible for anything that happens to you, your printer, electricity bill, house, social life, finances or even if you unleash a nuclear war with this firmware.  

If you don't have the same setup you shouldn't use this firmware.  
Heck, even if you have the same setup you shouldn't use it.  

I'm just a ü¶ç eating üñçÔ∏è and smashing a nice keyboard.

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because they believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While they can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.

*Personally I don't care what you do with this firmware, nobody's responsible for your actions except you.*
